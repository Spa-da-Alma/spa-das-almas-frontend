After the SP/MG border, drive for another 30 km through the towns of Extrema and Itapeva and enter Camanducaia to access the 29 km Camanducaia/M.Verde road up the mountain. At about Km 13 there will be a bridge. After this bridge, take the second right and follow it for another 17 km until you reach the city gate. After reaching the gate, follow Monte Verde Avenue, which is the continuation of the road, until Bradesco Square. You can go straight ahead, going around the curve on the right at the Chalana restaurant on Rua da Represa and going straight ahead until a fork where you should go up on the left until you reach the Spa da Alma guesthouse, which is at the end of this street! We are at Rua da Represa, 1477. "
